# Submission Notes

I really enjoyed the style of this assignment, I felt it was a very practical approach to
what is likely to come up on the job rather than having to complete very theory-heavy / algorithm
based questions; although this is important to know as well to a certain extent, this style of
assessing I feel demonstrates the experience and problem-solving abilities of the developer.

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

If I had more time to complete this assignment I would have gone down the route of extending
the requirements and adding pagination to the project, as a means of providing an
overall better user experience and flow.

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

I feel as though the only thing that I may have went off course with was handling broken images and data manipulation from the API.
I also added some DOM elements to the first exercise, as I did not understand how this would have been possible without at least
adding an icon to the HTML. I could have utilised the ::before pseudo class to have elements appear before the testimonial, but nevertheless, this was the approach I took.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?
